# Webcam use case

Gifbooth is using webcam to create gifs from pictures taken by webcam. To do that we use `webcam.js` framework.

You need to check your webcam resolution and set it with proper proportions in `server/public/js/controllers/take_photo_screen.js`. If you miss this configuration you'll have problems with taking photos from web camera.

Before you'll take a photo you need to add permission in your browser. App tested on `Google Chrome` browser.
